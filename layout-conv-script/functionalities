a - normal key 
	mod-key

ex cmg-c
   c
   spc

   gui

b special keys
	// keytype key-code key-code key-code
	// will be a escape sequence to indicate a "special key" 
	define in script documentation the order which the keys will be interpreted 

	// 
As for initializing in C. Outbut can be a matrix of char * and each element is a string literally. 
char *mappings[NUM_KEYS][NUM_LAYERS] = 
{ {"###0x00000000", ...}, 
  ....
}

The script always output the first 3 characters being numbers matching the type of they key according to the enum. After that the string can be be broken into blocks of 10 characters. Each block will be a keycode accodring to the std set on my code 0xTTLLMMKK Toggle, layer, mod, key. 

Forgot how to represent toggle keys
