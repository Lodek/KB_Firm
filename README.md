Firmware for a simple USB keyboard.
The firmware implement a minimal set of features, only things I use.
I started this in 2017 and it is what got me in programming.
I plan on refactoring this code a bit so I can use it with more ease and eventually migrate it to Rust.

If you're interested in making use of it, don't!
It lacks documentation and unless you're willing to learn how a keyboard work on the insides, it will be a frustrating experience.
However, if you are *really* motivated and need some help, reach out and I will give you a hand.
